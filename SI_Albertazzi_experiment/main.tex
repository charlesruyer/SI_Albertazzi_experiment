Figures \ref{fig:PIC_las}a-f illustrate, at $t=0.41$ ps (\emph{i.e.} $1.44$ ps after the beginning of the simulation) our large scale full PIC 2D simulation of an aluminum foil irradiated by a  temporally Gaussian laser beam of  FWHM $690$ fs and maximum intensity $3.5 \times 10^{19}$ W.cm$^{-2}$ that reached the target at $t=0$ on the left simulation boundary. The spatial profile is Gaussian with a $6\, \mu$m FWHM focused on the aluminum $3\,\mu$m-thick target (see section Methods for details). 
The beam inclination is of  $-31$ degrees compared to the target normal and propagates from the bottom-left corner of the simulation toward the center of the foil.
Figures \ref{fig:PIC_las}a,b,c show that self generated electric and magnetic fluctuations associated with a current are triggered in the expanding plasma [see Fig. \ref{fig:PIC_las}d] at $x\sim 50 \, \mu$m and far from the focal spot $y>75\, \mu$m. 
These fields develop preferentially in the upper part of the simulation compared to where the laser points to, suggesting that the  hot electron plays a crucial role in triggering the instability. The initial directionality of these fluctuations is consistent with the early time experimental observation shown in Fig. \ref{fig:rcf_supp}.
Indeed, the modulations revealed by the probing protons mainly develop on the left side of the laser irradiation spot, consistently with  the laser  that arrives   from the right side of the RCF.
Afterward, as illustrated in Fig. 2 of the main paper, the distribution of the spot-like structures   becomes independent of the laser orientation, \emph{i.e.} the structures are observed all over the target surface.
In our full PIC simulation,  the magnetic field is composed of small wavelength ($\sim 6\,\mu$m) magnetic fluctuations of amplitude $300-500$ T superimposed to a Biermann battery B field of amplitude $\sim 1500$ T.

The $y$-aligned momentum flux  averaged over the electrons of energy larger than 100 eV is  illustrated  in Figs.  \ref{fig:PIC_las}e after the laser-energy deposition, showing that the hot electron pressure is larger in the y direction than normally to the target plane, except at the center of the foil (at the irradiation region), where the hot electron pressure remains isotropic. 
We now introduce  $K_x$ and $K_y$, the $x$ and $y$-aligned   momentum flux averaged over the hot electrons.
The profile  of $K_x/K_y-1$ illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:PIC_las}f demonstrates that  the anisotropy polarity is reversed in the dense and the underdense part of the target. In the expanding plasma for $x \le 50\, \mu$m we find  $K_y < K_x$, consistently with the anisotropy expected from the Weibel-type instabilities responsible for the field and magnetic field observed in Figs.  \ref{fig:PIC_las}a,b.

A y-lineout of the hot electrons density (of energy larger than 100 eV) at the end of the simulation ($t=0.41$ ps)   is illustrated in  Fig. \ref{fig:nhcut}a and presents a maximum density of $n_h\sim 5 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$ and spatial extension of roughly $R_0 \sim 30\, \mu$m. These parameters have been used as initial hot electron parameters for the PIC-MHD simulation addressing the late time electron dynamics in the resistive medium.

and  growth rate, \textbf{b}, of the numerical solution of the dispersion relation given by Eq. (5) of Ref. \cite[]{POP_Yoon_2007b}, plotted as a function of the electron temperature anisotropy and the $y$-aligned temperature.}
\end{figure}
In this section we investigate the instability triggered in the expanding plasma and responsible for the magnetic, electric  and current modulations illustrated in Figs. \ref{fig:PIC_las}a,b,c. 
The $x,p_x$ phase space extracted at $y=117\, \mu$m in Fig. \ref{fig:nhcut}b shows two counter-streaming electron beams in qualitative accordance with the scenario retained in Ref. \cite[]{PRL_Gode_2017}. 
However, the growth rate and wavevector are estimated in this reference assuming that both counter-streaming populations have equal density at the location of the magnetic field fluctuations. 
In our particular case, the phase space of Fig. \ref{fig:nhcut}b seems to contradict this argument   as the return-current population has a density which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the fast electrons.
A dispersion  relation  more adapted to the hot electrons properties has been derived in Ref. \cite[]{POP_Yoon_2007b} for a relativistic two temperature distribution function which follows 
\begin{align}
    f &= A \exp\left[ -\frac{m_ec^2}{T_x}(\gamma -\gamma_y) -\frac{m_ec^2}{T_y}\gamma_y \right]\, , \\
    A &= \frac{1}{4\pi m_e^3c^3T_xK_2(T_y^{-1}) } \left[1+\left(\frac{T_x}{T_y}-1\right)\frac{T_yK_1(T_y^{-1})}{K_2(T_y^{-1})}  \right]^{-1}\, ,\\
    \gamma &= \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{p_x^2 +p_y^2}{m_e^2c^2}} \, , \\
    \gamma_y &=  \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{p_y^2}{m_e^2c^2}} \, .
\end{align}
We introduced the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order one and two, $K_1$ and $K_2$ respectively.
Overall, the value of the maximum growth rate,  $\Gamma_p$ and the most unstable wavelength $\lambda_p$ or wavevector $k_p$ read
\begin{align}
   \Gamma_p &\simeq \alpha_\Gamma \omega_{ph}  \label{eq:gp} \, , \\ 
   l_p &\simeq \alpha_\lambda 2\pi c/\omega_{ph} \label{eq:lp}  \, , \\
      k_p &\simeq \alpha_\lambda^{-1} \omega_{ph}/c\label{eq:kp}  \, ,
\end{align}
where the  proportionality factors $\alpha_\Gamma$ and $\alpha_\lambda$, have been computed by resolving numerically Eq. (5) of Ref. \cite[]{POP_Yoon_2007b} and are illustrated in Figs. \ref{fig:dispe_yoon}a,b.
Note that the approximation  ($\Gamma_p^2 \ll k_p^2 c^2$) made while deriving Eq (7) of Ref. \cite[]{POP_Yoon_2007b} is found to be wrong in our case.
The electron anisotropy and temperature of our 2D full PIC simulation can be extracted from  Figs. \ref{fig:PIC_las}e,f giving   $T_y/m_ec^2 \sim 0.6$ and $ T_x/T_y -1\simeq 1 $, so that  $\alpha_\Gamma \sim 0.1$ and $\alpha_\lambda \sim 2$ (see Figs. \ref{fig:dispe_yoon}a,b).

We will then assume that, in Eqs. \eqref{eq:gp}-\eqref{eq:kp},  the radial hot electron dilution, which is not captured by our reduced PIC simulation but should be accounted for regarding the experiment, only affects the plasma frequency. 
We thus choose to neglect the effect of 2D \emph{vs.} 3D geometry  on the parameters $\alpha_\Gamma$ and $\alpha_\lambda$,  arguing that they mainly enclose the influence of the hot electron anisotropy and energy and are essentially independent of the electron density.

\section{Resistive Dispersion relation} \label{sec:dispe_res}
Addressing the field fluctuations located inside the dense foil, 
we derive here the electromagnetic dispersion relation of a homogeneous and resistive plasma in the presence of a hot-electron population. The hot electrons ($h$-subscript) and the ions ($i$-subscript) will be both  described by a multi-Maxwellian distribution, while the cold electrons ($c$-subscript) that ensure charge and current neutralization will be assumed to fulfill a generalized Ohm's law. Introducing the first-order perturbation of the  current, $\mathbf{j}^{(1)} = \mathbf{j}_i^{(1)} +\mathbf{j}_h^{(1)}+\mathbf{j}_c^{(1)}$, we will express the ion and hot electron contributions, $\mathbf{j}_i^{(1)}$ and $\mathbf{j}_h^{(1)}$, by linearizing the Vlasov-Maxwell equations.
We will here assume  $\mathbf{j}_h^{(1)} +\mathbf{j}_i^{(1)} =- \sigma \mathbf{E} +\mu_0^{-1}\nabla \times \mathbf{B} - \epsilon_0 \partial_t \mathbf{E}$ where $\sigma$, $\mathbf{E}$, $\mathbf{B}$, $\mu_0$, and $\epsilon_0$ are the electrical conductivity,  electric field, magnetic field, vacuum permeability and permittivity respectively.
We then obtain 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rose}
i \sum_{s =h,i} \omega_{ps}^2 \int d\mathbf{p} \frac{\nabla_pf_s}{\omega -\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}}\cdot \left( 1 +\mathbf{v}\times \frac{\mathbf{k}}{\omega} \times \right)\mathbf{E}
+ i\omega \left( 1 + \frac{\sigma }{i\omega \epsilon_0}+ \frac{\mathbf{k}}{\omega}\times \frac{\mathbf{k}}{\omega} \times \right)\mathbf{E} =0 \, .
\end{equation}
The first hand side of the above equation corresponds to the hot electron and ion current from the linearized Vlasov equation. The second hand side is the generalized Ohms'law.
The determinant of Eq. \eqref{eq:rose} can be expressed as a function of the  collisionless  plasma susceptibility tensor, $\epsilon =  1 + \sum_{s = i,h} \chi_s\omega_{ps}^2/\omega^2$, where $\omega_{ps}$ is the plasma frequency of the $s$-species.

Although  derived in a Cartesian geometry, we will assume that this dispersion relation can still be applied locally, far from the irradiated region. At a distance of $\sim 100\, \mu$m away from the hot spot, the hot electrons drift in the radial direction and are cooler in the poloidal direction than in the x direction. We will therefore model the hot electrons by the following Maxwellian distribution function 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:distrib}
f_h(v_r, v_\phi,v_x) \propto \exp\left[ -\frac{m_ev_\phi^2}{2T_\phi} -\frac{m_ev_x^2}{2T_x} -\frac{m_e(v_h-v_r)^2}{2T_r} \right]\, .
\end{equation}
We introduced the poloidal, $x$ and radial temperature and drift velocity, $T_\phi$, $T_x$, $T_r$, $v_r$ respectively. 
Note that, we make use of the index $\phi$, $x$ and $r$ only to ease the comparison with the experimental geometry, the dispersion relations are Cartesian.

%In the non-relativistic regime the dispersion relation associated with the three possible planes are independent. 
We will now consider the case where the wavevector and perturbed current lie in the $(r,\phi)$-plane, \emph{i.e.} the target plane.
The determinant of Eq.~\eqref{eq:rose} gives
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dispe0}
\left(\omega^2 \epsilon_{rr} - k_\phi^2c^2 +\frac{i\omega}{\tau_E}\right)
\left(\omega^2 \epsilon_{\phi\phi} - k_r^2c^2 +\frac{i\omega}{\tau_E}\right)
-\left(\omega^2 \epsilon_{r\phi} - k_\phi k_rc^2\right)^2 = 0 \, ,
\end{equation}
where use has been made of $\tau_E = \epsilon_0/\sigma$.

\subsection{Case of a wavevector perpendicular to the drift velocity (poloidal)}

Solving the dispersion relation for a wavevector perpendicular to the drift velocity corresponds, in the experiment, to a poloidal wavevector [instability seen in Fig.~4a at $r = 200\, \mu$m]: $k = k_\phi$. 
Plugging $k = k_\phi$ into Eq. \eqref{eq:dispe0} gives
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dispe}
\left(\omega^2 \epsilon_{rr} - k_\phi^2c^2 +\frac{i\omega}{\tau_E}\right)
\left(\omega^2 \epsilon_{\phi\phi} +\frac{i\omega}{\tau_E}\right)
-\omega^4 \epsilon_{r\phi}^2 = 0 \, ,
\end{equation}
In this case, the bi-Maxwellian susceptibility tensor verifies \cite[]{POP_Ruyer_2015}
\begin{align}
 \epsilon &=  1 + \sum_{s = i,h}\frac{\omega_{ps}^2}{\omega^2}  \chi_s\, , \label{eq:eps}\\
  \chi_{rr} &= -1  + \frac{m_sv_s^2 + T_{sr} }{T_{s\phi}} [1+\xi_s\mathcal{Z}(\xi_s) ]\, \label{eq:chixx},\\
  \chi_{\phi\phi} &=-\xi^2 \partial_\xi\mathcal{Z}(\xi_s) \, ,\\
  \chi_{r\phi} & =  -v_s\sqrt{\frac{m_s}{2T_{s\phi}}} \xi_s \partial_\xi \mathcal{Z}(\xi_s)  \label{eq:chixy}\, ,\\
  \xi_s  &= \frac{\omega }{k_\phi} \sqrt{\frac{m_s}{2T_{s\phi}}}\label{eq:xi} \, .
\end{align}
The approximate analytical resolution of the dispersion relation can be achieved with a Taylor development of the dispersion function $\mathcal{Z}(\xi_s)$. For $\vert \xi_h \vert\gg 1$
\begin{align}
\mathcal{Z}(\xi_h) & =  i\pi^{1/2}(1-\xi_h^2) -2\xi_h +\frac{4}{3}\xi_h^3 + \mathrm{O}(\xi_h^5) \label{eq:taylor1} \, ,\\
d_{\xi_h} \mathcal{Z}(\xi_h)  &= -2\xi_h -2i\pi^{1/2}\xi_h^2 +4\xi_h^3+ \mathrm{O}(\xi_h^5)\label{eq:taylor2} \, .
\end{align}
Assuming immobile ions and introducing  $E_{sx} = m_sv_s^2 + T_{sx}$, the third order Taylor development of \eqref{eq:chixx}-\eqref{eq:chixy} gives
\begin{align}
  \chi_{rr} &\simeq -1  + \frac{E_{hx} }{T_{hy}} + \frac{E_{hx} }{T_{hy}} ( i\pi^{1/2}\xi_h -2\xi_h^2 -i\pi^{1/2}\xi_h^3) \, ,\\
  \chi_{\phi\phi} &\simeq2\xi_h^2+ 2i\pi^{1/2}\xi_h^3 \, ,\\
  \chi_{r\phi} & \simeq  -v_h\sqrt{\frac{m_s}{2T_{hy}}} (2\xi_h + 2i\pi^{1/2}\xi_h^2 -4\xi_h^3) \, .
\end{align}
To third order in $\omega$, Eq.~$\eqref{eq:dispe}$ can be recast as a second order polynomial equation 
\begin{align}
&\mathcal{A}\omega^2 +\mathcal{B}\omega +\mathcal{C} = 0\, , \label{eq:dispepoloidal} \\
\mathcal{A}& =\frac{2i}{\tau_E} + i\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{E_{hr} }{T_{h\phi}}\frac{\omega_{ph}^2}{k_\phi v_{th\phi}} -\frac{i}{\tau_E}\frac{\omega_{ph}^2}{k_\phi^2 v_{th\phi}^2}(a_\phi-1) 
+i\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\omega_{ph}^4}{k_\phi^3 v_{th\phi}^3} \frac{T_{hr} }{T_{h\phi}} \label{eq:a} \, , \\
\mathcal{B} & =   - \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{E_{hr} }{T_{h\phi}}\frac{\omega_{ph}^2}{k_\phi v_{th\phi} \tau_E}
+\omega_{ph}^2(a_\phi-1)-\omega_{ph}^2 \frac{c^2}{v_{th\phi}^2} -k_\phi^2 c^2 -\frac{1}{\tau_E^2 } 
 + \frac{\omega_{ph}^4}{k_\phi^2 v_{th\phi}^2}\left[(a_\phi-1)- \frac{v_h^2}{2v_{th\phi}^2} \right]  \, , \label{eq:b} \\
\mathcal{C} & =\frac{i}{\tau_E}(\omega_{ph}^2 a_\phi -k_\phi^2c^2 )\label{eq:c}\, , 
\end{align}
where $a_\phi = E_{hr}/T_{h\phi}$ and $v_{th\phi} = \sqrt{T_{h\phi}/m_e}$. 
The above equation gives
\begin{equation}
\omega  = -\frac{\mathcal{B}}{2\mathcal{A}}\left(1\pm \sqrt{1-\frac{4\mathcal{A}\mathcal{C}}{\mathcal{B}^2}} \right)
\label{eq:dispesol}\, .
\end{equation}
In order to apply the above result to the case of the $(\phi,x)$-anisotropy [\emph{i.e.} the case of a wavevector and perturbed current lying in the $(\phi,x)$], one just needs to use $v_h = 0$ and replace $r$ by $x$.

Figures~\ref{fig:gamma_ky}a,c,e plot the growth rate associated with an anisotropy in the $(r, \phi)$ and $(\phi,x)$-plane using the above equations and as a function of the wavevector normalized to $1\, \mu$m ($k_yc/\omega_0 = 1\mu\mathrm{m}/\lambda_\phi$) with and without resistivity in plain and dashed lines respectively. 
In all cases, the presence of a resistive background electrons significantly decreases the Weibel growth rate (by more than an order of magnitude) and the wavevector of the fastest-growing mode (by a factor $\sim 3$). 
Our dispersion relations allows us to disentangle the influence of the particle streaming or the pressure anisotropy on the growth of the resistive filamentation. 
%The fastest growing mode is obtained when the pressure anisotropy is carried by the temperature like in Figs.~\ref{fig:gamma_ky}c,d  where $v_h = 0$ which demonstrates that the instability of poloidal wavevector is triggered, in our case, by the temperature anisotropy, and not the streaming of particles.
Finally, the argument of the Taylor expansion of Eqs.~\eqref{eq:taylor1}-\eqref{eq:taylor2}, illustrated in Figs. \ref{fig:gamma_ky}b,d,f,
verifies $\xi_h \lesssim 0.1$ in the region where the growth rate is maximized.

\subsection{Analytical estimates of the dominant mode}

In order to obtain a simple analytical formulation of the dominant mode wavevector and growth rate, we will first only retain the dominant terms of Eqs. \eqref{eq:a}-\eqref{eq:c}. In our system for which $\omega_{ph} \tau_E \ll 1$, we obtain
\begin{align}
\mathcal{A} & \simeq \frac{2i}{\tau_E}  \label{eq:a2} \, , \\
\mathcal{B} & \simeq    - \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{K_{hr} }{T_{h\phi}}\frac{\omega_{ph}^2}{k_\phi v_{th\phi} \tau_E}
 -\frac{1}{\tau_E^2 }  \, , \label{eq:b2} \\
\mathcal{C} & \simeq \frac{i}{\tau_E}(\omega_{ph}^2 a_\phi -k_\phi^2c^2 )\label{eq:c2}\, , 
\end{align}

Combined with Eq. \eqref{eq:dispesol}, it follows
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\phi  \simeq \frac{1}{4}  \sqrt{ \left( \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\omega_{ph}^2}{k_\phi v_{th,\phi}}a_\phi    + \frac{1}{\tau_E} \right)^2 +  8(\omega_{ph}^2 a_\phi  - k_\phi^2 c^2 )   }  -\frac{1}{4}   \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\omega_{ph}^2}{k_\phi v_{th,\phi}}a_\phi    -\frac{1}{4}   \frac{1}{\tau_E}
\label{eq:dispesol2}\, .
\end{equation}

 Solving $\partial_{k_\phi} \Gamma = 0 $ gives the wavevector that maximizes the growth rate and leads to a polynomial equation of the order ten, so that in order to have a tractable estimate, we relate the dominant wavevector $k_\mathrm{max}$ to $k_\star$ which is defined as $\Gamma_\phi (k_\star>0)=0$. We will then relate $k_\mathrm{max}$ to a fraction of $k_\star =  a_\phi^{1/2}\omega_{ph}/c$, giving 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ksat}
k_\mathrm{max} \simeq 0.5 k_\star = \frac{a_\phi^{1/2}\omega_{ph}}{2c} \, .
\end{equation}
%We therefore deduce the effective growth rate 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:gf}
%\Gamma_\phi(k_\mathrm{sat})  \simeq \frac{1}{4}  \sqrt{ \left( 2\sqrt{\frac{\pi m_ec^2}{2T_{h0}}} \omega_{ph}a_\phi    + \frac{1}{\tau_E} \right)^2 +  6\omega_{ph}^2 a_\phi   }  -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi m_ec^2}{2T_{h0}}} \omega_{ph} a_\phi   -\frac{1}{4}   \frac{1}{\tau_E}
%\end{equation}
Figures \ref{fig:gamma_ky}a,c,e  illustrate successful comparisons between the growth rate of Eq. \eqref{eq:dispesol} (blue plain line) and its approximation, Eq. \eqref{eq:dispesol2}  (red plain line) for  solid-density plasma relevant for our study. In particular, the maximum of the growth rate is well reproduced by our approximated formula.

\section{Spatio-temporal evolution of the plasma parameters}
We will here examine the hot-electron plasma parameters and their evolution as a function of space and time. 

\subsection{Hot electron dynamics in an insulator and in a conductor-type target} 
Figures \ref{fig:nt}a-f present the radial profiles of the hot and cold electron ($\ge 100$ eV) parameters for the two PIC-MHD cases, $\log(\Lambda)=2$ and $20$. 
It is instructive to assess that no significant difference is observed between these two cases regarding $n_h$, $v_r$, $T_x$ and $E_r$ (\emph{i.e.} the hot electron density, radial drift velocity, $x$-aligned temperature and radial momentum flux averaged over the hot electrons). Only the poloidal temperature (Fig. \ref{fig:nt}e) presents a slightly larger temperature for the insulator ($\log(\Lambda)=20$)  than the conductor ($\log(\Lambda)=2$) in the region $r\gtrsim 50\, \mu$m. 
%This suggests that the hot electron density and temperature profiles, for fast enough particles, weakly depends on the background electrons at early times.
In contrast, Fig. \ref{fig:nt}b shows that the cold electron ($\lesssim 100$ eV) density is larger in a high resistivity than in a low resistivity target. Indeed, a larger resistive current implies a larger amount of impact ionization and therefore a larger cold electron density, consistently with our PIC-MHD simulations. 

Regarding the second moments of the hot electron distribution, 
the   poloidal  temperature verifies $T_\phi\sim 10$ keV and  is  smaller than the corresponding radial momentum flux and the $x$-aligned temperature ($E_r\gtrsim 70$ keV and $T_x\gtrsim 100$ keV),  as evidenced by Figs. \ref{fig:nt}c-e for $r\gtrsim 50\, \mu$m. This configuration is therefore unstable regarding the resistive filamentation instability with a wavevector aligned with the poloidal direction, as derived in Sec. \ref{sec:dispe_res}. 
 
Figures \ref{fig:nt}f and  Fig. 3e of the main paper compare two growth rates, solution of the dispersion relation derived in Sec. \ref{sec:dispe_res}  with the plasma parameters extracted from both PIC-MHD simulations ($\log(\Lambda)=2$ and $20$).
As expected, the system is more unstable for the large resistivity case ($\log(\Lambda)=20$), in agreement with the experimental observations and the  most unstable wavelength verifies $\lambda_\phi \sim 5\, \mu$m, in fair agreement with  the PIC-MHD simulation  for which $\lambda_\phi \sim 5-10\, \mu$m.
Note that the growth rate of the Weibel-type instability triggered in the expanding plasma verifies $\Gamma\simeq \alpha_\Gamma \omega_{ph}\sim 2.6\,\rm ps^{-1}$ [Eq. \eqref{eq:gp}], and therefore lies between the two resistive filamentation  growth rate  of Fig. \ref{fig:nt}f (Fig.~3e of the main paper), which is consistent with our scenario.



\subsection{Hot electrons density evolution}
Let us assume that the hot electrons, initially located in a circle of radius $R_0$, have a density   $n_{h0}$ and a temperature $T_{h0}$. The cold electron  population initially verifies charge neutrality and has a temperature $T_{c0}$.
A simple way to estimate the time-decreasing density of the fast electrons, $n_h(r,t)$, as they expand radially, is by expressing particle number conservation for  the hot electron population.
For an initial energy  deposition radius $R_0$, the electrons will drift radially, so that after a time t, the fast electrons will be  filling a surface $\propto ( R_0 + v_{h0}t)^D$ (see Figs. \ref{fig:n_param}a,b), where D is the number of dimensions in the foil plane and $(T_{h0}/m_e)^{1/2}= v_{h0}$.
The size of the target in the expanding direction follows $\propto (L+c_st)^\delta$ where $c_s$, $L$ and $\delta$ are  the hot electron sound speed, the target initial thickness and the number of dimension in the expanding direction, respectively. 
For an homogeneous distribution of the hot electrons over their light cone, the conservation of the particle number gives
\begin{equation} \label{eq:nt}
n_h(r,t)  \simeq\alpha_n n_{h0} \left( \frac{R_0}{R_0 + v_{h0}t } \right)^D \left( \frac{L}{L + c_{s}t } \right)^\delta  H \left( 1 + \frac{v_{h0}t-r}{R_0} \right) \, ,
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the step function and $\alpha_n$  is the fraction of hot electrons that effectively spread radially.
Figure  \ref{fig:n_param}a presents the  homogeneous  hot electron density profile extracted from one  MHD-PIC simulations at two times  and is found to be in agreement with our estimates.
The temporal evolution of the spatially averaged hot electron density (normalized to $n_{h0}$) is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:n_param}a for PIC MHD simulations performed with various initial cold electron temperature. 
A  very good agreement is obtained, when comparing  our numerical results  with the  estimate of Eq. \eqref{eq:nt} using $v_{h0} = c/2$ and $\alpha_n = 0.25$.
Moreover, Figs. \ref{fig:n_param}b,c suggests that for $r\gtrsim 100\,\mu$m  the hot electron density profile remains fairly flat at late times ($t\gtrsim 0.65$ ps).

\section{ Sensitivity of the diagnostics to the Weibel instability in the expanding plasma} 

\subsection{Deflection of a probing proton off magnetic fluctuations}
The proton radiographs obtained experimentally presents small contrasts variations and are therefore not in the so-called caustics regime, implying that the probing protons were weakly deflected by the self-generated fields.
Reference \cite[]{RSI_protograhyb} proposes a  deflection angle estimates that can be applied to our study.
The  cylindrical Gaussian current filament case is addressed in Sec. VI.D. of Ref.  \cite[]{RSI_protograhyb}, using a radial extent of $a\equiv\lambda_p$ and a longitudinal length given be the target thickness $b\equiv L_p$.

The numerical applications of  Sec. VI.D. of Ref.  \cite[]{RSI_protograhyb} are presented in the limit of   elongated filaments ($b\equiv L_p\gg a\equiv\lambda_p $). In our case where the filament  extends on the thickness of the target, $L_p$  verifies $ L_p \lesssim \lambda_p$ and the resulting deflection angle is given by the combination of Eqs. (53), (54) and (102) of Ref.  \cite[]{RSI_protograhyb} for $d = ( \lambda_p^2\cos^2\theta + L_p^2 \sin^2 \theta)^{1/2} \simeq  \lambda_p$ (where $\theta$ is the probing angle of protons normal to the target that verifies $\theta\lesssim 0.1$ rad) and reads
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alphaphith}
\theta^B_x(x_0,y_0) \simeq \pi^{1/2} x_0 \frac{L_p }{\lambda_p}  \frac{e B_p }{m_p v_p} \exp\left(-\frac{x_0^2}{\lambda_p^2}-\frac{y_0^2}{ \lambda_p^2} \right)\, ,
\end{equation}
where we introduced the position $x_0$ and $y_0$ of the probing proton relatively to the center of the current filament.
Maximizing the above equation relatively to $x_0$ and $y_0$ gives
\begin{equation}
\theta^B_p = \max_{x_0,y_0}[\alpha_x(x_0,y_0) ] \simeq \frac{\pi^{1/2}}{2\exp(1/2)} \frac{e  B_p L_p }{m_p v_p}\, . \label{eq:alaphaphi}
\end{equation}
The resulting maximum deflection angle thus depends on the magnetic field amplitude,  $  B_p$ at saturation and on the filament length, $L_p$, of the probed Weibel instability.

The instability that results from the refluxing of electrons in the expanding plasma creates magnetic field typical wavelength and most unstable growth rate given by Eqs.  \eqref{eq:gp} and \eqref{eq:lp}.
Making use of the so-called Davidson criterion \cite[]{POF_Davidson_1972} that equates the bouncing electron frequency with the growth rate at saturation of the Weibel instability, one can relate the amplitude of the magnetic field to the growth rate $\Gamma_p$,  the dominant wavelength  $\lambda_p$ and  the hot electrons drift velocity and Lorentz factor ($v_{hx}$ and $\gamma_h$ respectively). Our simulation suggests $v_{hx}\sim c/2$ and $\gamma_h \sim 1$, which yields,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bp}
B_p \simeq \frac{m_e \Gamma_p^2 \lambda_p}{2\pi e v_{hx}} =   \alpha_\Gamma^2 \alpha_\lambda   \frac{m_ec\omega_{ph}c}{ e v_{hx}} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $v_{hx}$ is the amplitude of the electron velocity modulation in the vicinity of the current filaments, which value will be set to $v_{hx}\sim c/2$ in the following (see Fig. \ref{fig:cut}c).
The length of the filament can be related to the scale length of the expanding underdense plasma, $L_p = c_{s} t$, where $c_{s}$ is the hot electron sound speed.
Applying the above estimates to the full 2D PIC simulation for $t = 1.44$ ps, gives for $D=\delta=1$, 
 $n_h \simeq 3.4 \times 10^{19}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ [Eq. \eqref{eq:nt} for $n_{h0}=5\times 10^{21}$  cm$^{-3}$, $R_0=30\, \mu$m, $\alpha_n = 0.25$ and $v_{h0}=0.5c$],  $\lambda_p \simeq 13.2 \,\rm \mu m$ and  $B_p \simeq 190\,\rm T$, of the same order than  the results extracted from the lineout of Fig. \ref{fig:cut}a,  $\lambda_p \sim 6.6 \, \mu$m 
and  $B_p \sim 300-500$ T.

In the experiment $(D,\delta)=(2,1)$ at 4 ps, the hot electron density is $n_h\simeq2.7 \times 10^{17}\,\rm cm^{-3}$, which gives $\lambda_p\simeq 130\, \mu$m and a magnetic field of approximately $\sim 17$ T. 
At this time, the length of the filament is around  $L_p \sim c_st \sim 38\, \mu$m, which is smaller than  $\lambda_p$.
Hence, the maximum deflection angle resulting from  the magnetic filaments probed in the direction of the current is obtained by combining Eqs. \eqref{eq:alaphaphi} and \eqref{eq:bp}
%%directly from Eq. (104) of \cite[]{RSI_protograhyb} and reads
\begin{equation}
\theta^B_p \simeq  \frac{\alpha_\Gamma^2 \alpha_\lambda \pi^{1/2}}{2\exp(1/2)}      \frac{m_eL_p\omega_{ph}}{2\pi\gamma_h^{1/2}m_p v_p} \, . \label{eq:alaphap}
\end{equation}
Hence, the probing proton deflection angle $\theta_p^B$ (and therefore the RCF dose variation) off  the Weibel-induced magnetic field triggered in the expanding plasma should 
depend on the plasma parameters as $\omega_pL_p$. Using of $L_p \sim c_st $ and Eq. \eqref{eq:nt} for $(D,\delta)=(2,1)$, we obtain $\theta^B_p\propto c_s/(1+c_st/L)^{1/2}$ (for $t\gg R_0/c\simeq 100$ fs). The probing proton deflection angle should therefore slowly decrease as the   target expands on hydrodynamical times scales.
This is in qualitative accordance with the experimental observation showing a weak temporal evolution of the proton dose variation over the 10s of picoseconds of the experimental observations.

\subsection{Deflection of a probing proton off electric fluctuations}
 We address here the sensitivity of the probing protons to the electric field that develops around the current filaments in the expanding plasma.
Although, of mainly magnetic nature, the Weibel instability can also trigger, in its saturated regime, electric fields, as illustrated in  Fig. \ref{fig:PIC_las}c, that may influence the proton radiographic measurements.
 Figure \ref{fig:cut}b compares the lineout of the  $y$-aligned electric field (as a plain line) with a component resulting from $v_{e}\times \langle B_{z}\rangle_y$ (as a dashed line), where $v_{e}$ is the averaged electron drift velocity (see Fig. \ref{fig:cut}c) and $\langle B_z\rangle_y \sim 1500$ T corresponds to the spacial averaged of $B_z$ over $80\,\mu$m $\le y\le 120\, \mu$m (see Fig. \ref{fig:cut}a).
 The very good agreement obtained demonstrates that, in our reduced geometry simulation, the electric  fluctuations result from the drift of the electrons  in the large scale magnetic (Biermann-battery) field.
The range of the $\nabla n\times \nabla T$-field, expected to be much larger  in our reduced geometry PIC simulation than in the experiment, can be estimated in the radiographs of  Fig. 2, to be of radius $r\lesssim 200\, \mu$m.
Hence, since the large scale $B$-field is   vanishing for  $r> 200\, \mu$m, the associated $v\times B$ component is expected to be negligible. 

However, in the non-linear stage of the Weibel-type instablities as pointed out in Refs. \cite{POP_Dieckmann_2009, POP_Bret_Gremillet_2010}, the current-carrying electrons  are,  unlike the ions,  pinched by the magnetic field loops creating an electric field  resulting from the charge imbalance. In first approximation, its amplitude  may be estimated by a balance between the electric field and  the  magnetic pressure, $en_hE_p \sim  - \nabla B_p^2/(2 \mu_0)$. 
Using Eqs. \eqref{eq:lp} and  \eqref{eq:bp}, we obtain  for $\nabla\equiv 2\pi/\lambda_p$
\begin{align}
E_p& \sim -  \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_p} \frac{B_p^2}{ 2\mu_0 e n_h }
\sim -  \frac{eB_p^2 \lambda_p}{  4\pi  m_e \alpha_\lambda} \, ,
 \label{eq:ep1}  \\
E_p& \sim \frac{\alpha_\lambda^2 \alpha_\Gamma^4}{2} \frac{c^2}{v_h^2} \frac{m_ec\omega_{ph}}{e  }   \label{eq:ep}
 \, .
\end{align}
Note that such estimates has been used  in Refs. \cite{POP_Dieckmann_2009,POP_Ruyer_2015,PRL_Gode_2017} for comparison with experiments and numerical results.  
For our 2D full PIC simulation, we obtain $E_p\sim 1.4 $ GV/m which is fairly consistent with Fig. \ref{fig:cut}b.  Regarding the experiment, the electric field modulation amplitude verifies  $E_p \sim 0.12$ GV/m at $t=4$ ps.

As in Sec. IV.A, the typical probing proton deflection angle is obtained by combining Eq.  (53)-(55) of Ref. \cite[]{RSI_protograhyb} for $d\simeq a= \lambda_p/2 $
with $\theta \ll 1$. 
It is given by the ratio between the electric potential jump $\Phi_p\sim E_p(\lambda_p/2)/(2\pi)$ and the probing proton energy $W = m_pv_p^2/2$ 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alphaep0}
\theta^E_p \simeq \pi^{1/2}  \frac{L_p}{\lambda_p/2} \frac{e \Phi_p }{W}  \mathrm{max}_{x_0,y_0}\left[  
\frac{x_0}{\lambda_p/2}\exp\left(-\frac{x_0^2}{(\lambda_p/2)^2}-\frac{y_0^2}{ (\lambda_p/2)^2} \right) 
\right] \, .
\end{equation}
We thus obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alphaep}
 \theta^E_p \sim \frac{\pi^{1/2}}{2\exp(1/2)} \frac{L_p}{\lambda_p/2} \frac{e \Phi_p }{W} 
 %\sim \frac{\pi^{1/2}}{2\exp(1/2)}  \frac{L_p e E_p}{2\pi W}  
 \sim  \frac{\pi^{1/2}}{2\exp(1/2)}   \frac{m_ecL_p\omega_{ph}}{4\pi^3\gamma_h^{3/2}m_p v_p^2 }
 \, .
\end{equation}

Interestingly,  $\theta^E_p$ presents the same dependence on the plasma parameters as  $\theta^B_p$,  $\theta^E_p\propto L_p \omega_{ph}$. Hence,  the ratio $\theta^E_p/\theta^B_p =c/(2\pi^2v_p)$  is typically $\sim 35-50$\% for our   proton energy (between $4$ and $9.5$ MeV), and they can thus affect  the experimental measurements, consistently with the ILZ simulation results [see Figs. 2(e,i) and 4c].
Note that these estimates of the maximum deflection angle do not capture the influence of the different field topology  on the proton  deflection and  the resulting radiographs.

\subsection{Influence of the electric and magnetic fields topology on the resulting radiographs}
Since this electric field tends to compensate the pinching magnetic force on the electron population, it is radial and points toward the center of each current filament in the expanding plasma. Such topology tends to focus the probing protons toward the center of the filament independently of the polarity of the current (induced by  the hot electrons or by the target return current) or of the side of the target (front side or rear side) in which the instability is triggered. 
It contrasts with the influence of the magnetic field on the probing protons which focusing or defocussing character depends on the polarity of the current and on the side of the target. Indeed,  in the rear (respectively front) side, the return current filaments are focusing (defocussing) whereas the   particles leaving the target  tends to induce a defocussing (focusing) magnetic loop (see Fig. 2e of the main paper).

Overall,   at least two sets of field structures  are to be considered, the magnetically focusing  and  defocussing ones which  results in black and white spots respectively. 
The electric field which is always focusing, should partly  fade the white spots from the RCF and increase the contrast of the dark spots.  
Since the electric field profile has a quadratic dependence on the magnetic field, its influence on the radiographs is more and more significant  as the   $B$-field  amplitude  increases. Likewise,  the electric field amplitude is proportional to the magnetic wavelength [or inversely proportional to $n_e\lambda_p$, see Eq. \eqref{eq:ep1}] so that varying the 
parameters $a$ and $\lambda_p$ of Eqs. (6) and (7) of the main paper
allows to evidence various structures that may arise in the radiographs depending on the field profiles.

The minimum distance between each filament of same magnetic polarity is $ \lambda_p =100\, \mu$m  \textbf{a}, $ \lambda_p =120\, \mu$m \textbf{b} and $ \lambda_p =200\, \mu$m   \textbf{c}.
All scales are on the detector plane.

For  $ \lambda_p =100\, \mu$m (see Fig. \ref{fig:radiosup}a)  dark spots and dark crosses  may be seen. As  $ \lambda_p$ increases from $120\, \mu$m  to   $ 200\, \mu$m, the dark crosses disappear living only dark spots (see Fig. \ref{fig:radiosup}b), which, in turn, leave place to dark spot surrounded by white loops (see Fig. \ref{fig:radiosup}c). Qualitatively similar structures can be seen in the simulated radiographs shown in Figs. 2a,b,c of the main paper at various times and positions. 
The radiographs at $t =20$ ps  (Fig. 2c of the main paper) presents more dark spots surrounded by white loops than at $t= 13.5$ ps  (Fig. 2b),  which, as suggested by Figs. \ref{fig:radiosup}b,c, is qualitatively consistent with an increase of the magnetic wavelength due to a decrease of the hot electrons density and caused by a dilution of the expanding plasma plume at late times.

A few hundreds of microns away from the irradiated region, the target is likely to expand on the front and the rear side. 
For thin enough targets like in our case, one may expect both expansions to behave similarly, so that the  Weibel-induced electric and magnetic fields should develop with comparable wavelength and field amplitudes. 
In order to explore the contribution of both  sides of the target on the proton radiographs, we have performed ILZ simulations with two  sets of electromagnetic filaments placed on each side of the target (\emph{i.e.} separated in the $x$ direction by \textcolor{red}{three} microns).
To the best of our knowledge, no constrains on the relative position of the filaments on the two sides of the target can be found. 
Figure \ref{fig:radiosup2}a illustrate a case where the electric and magnetic fields of the two expanding region are shifted by half a magnetic wavelength in the $y$ direction. The horizontal lines appearing on the simulated RCF are the consequence of the focusing filaments which become aligned when projected on the detector.
Interestingly, when the field pattern are shifted by a full wavelength (so that the magnetic field loops are anti-aligned on each side of the target), as in Fig. \ref{fig:radiosup2}b, only dark points can be seen. In this case, the magnetic field contribution from both sides of the target cancel each other and the proton dose variation mainly results from the focusing electric field.

\caption{\label{fig:radiosup2}  
Modeled radiographs using the estimated electromagnetic field profiles of the filaments extending in the x direction.
The fields have the same parameters than in Fig. \ref{fig:rcf_supp}b, with the contribution of both the rear and the front sides of the target accounted for (see text).
The electric and magnetic field profiles of both sides have been shifted by half a wavelength for \textbf{a}.
For \textbf{b}, a shift of a full wavelength has been used so that the magnetic field loops are anti-aligned from one side of the target to the other.
All scales are on the target plane.
